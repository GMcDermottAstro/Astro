<h2>Markarian’s Chain – Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster</h2>
<p>
                    A wide-field portrait of Markarian’s Chain, a graceful arc of galaxies that forms part of the Virgo Cluster.
                    First noted by astronomer Benjamin Markarian, the chain includes bright elliptical galaxies such as M84 and M86,
                    along with many smaller island universes scattered across the frame.

<div class="card"><h2>The Northern Lights Over Tennessee</h2><p>A rare display of the aurora borealis drifting over Tennessee, painting the sky with soft curtains of magenta and green. Driven by a powerful geomagnetic storm, these colors form when charged particles from the Sun collide with oxygen and nitrogen high in Earth’s atmosphere. Seeing the northern lights this far south is an extraordinary event and a reminder of how dynamic our sky can be.</p><img alt="The Northern Lights Over Tennessee" src="images/aurora_tennessee_1.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>The Northern Lights Over Tennessee — Alternate View</h2><p class="description">A second perspective from the same auroral storm: soft green and magenta light spreads across the sky while power lines and trees frame the scene. A surreal blend of everyday Tennessee suburbia and polar skyfire over the American South. Wiki: Strong geomagnetic storms can push auroras much farther south than usual, making rare displays visible from mid-latitude locations.</p><img alt="Northern Lights over Tennessee alternate view" src="images/aurora_tennessee_2.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>The Heart of the Orion Nebula (M42)</h2><p>A close-up view of the brilliant core of the Orion Nebula, where the Trapezium Cluster of young, massive stars blasts the surrounding gas with intense radiation. This energy sculpts the glowing clouds and carves out dark cavities, revealing one of the nearest and most detailed examples of ongoing star formation in our galaxy.</p><img alt="The Heart of the Orion Nebula (M42)" src="images/orion_heart_core.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>Earthshine and the Crescent Moon</h2><p>A striking view of a young crescent Moon with its sunlit edge blazing bright while the rest of the lunar disk glows softly with earthshine—sunlight reflected from Earth back onto the Moon. An internal reflection in the optics creates a faint ghost image below, giving the impression of a double Moon and adding a surreal, dreamlike quality to the scene.</p><img alt="Earthshine and the Crescent Moon" src="images/earthshine_crescent.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>The Triangulum Galaxy (M33)</h2><p>The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is a graceful face-on spiral about 2.7 million light-years away and a key member of our Local Group. Its loose, open arms are filled with star-forming regions and glowing nebulae, with knots of young blue stars scattered throughout. Long-exposure imaging reveals its delicate structure and sprawling size—nearly 60,000 light-years across.</p><img alt="The Triangulum Galaxy (M33)" src="images/triangulum_m33.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>The Western Veil Nebula – The Witch’s Broom</h2><p>The Western Veil Nebula (NGC 6960), often called the Witch’s Broom, marks the western edge of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. This long, sweeping filament traces the shock front from a massive star that exploded thousands of years ago, with ionized oxygen glowing blue-green and hydrogen glowing deep red against the rich background star field.</p><img alt="The Eastern Veil Nebula – Filaments of an Ancient Supernova" src="images/veil_western.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>The Eastern Veil Nebula – Filaments of an Ancient Supernova</h2><p>The Eastern Veil Nebula (NGC 6992/6995) forms the bright, filamentary eastern edge of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. Its intricate, overlapping wisps of ionized gas trace the expanding shockwave from the same ancient stellar explosion, with teal oxygen and red hydrogen emissions revealing the fine structure of the blast as it tears through the interstellar medium.</p><img alt="The Eastern Veil Nebula – Filaments of an Ancient Supernova" src="images/veil_eastern.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>The Eagle Nebula (Pillars of Creation)</h2><p>The Eagle Nebula (Messier 16) is a young open cluster of stars embedded in a cloud of interstellar gas and dust located about 7,000 light-years away in the constellation Serpens. Its most famous feature—the Pillars of Creation—is a towering structure of dense molecular gas sculpted by intense ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. These pillars are active star‑forming regions where new suns are born inside collapsing knots of gas and dust. First imaged famously by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Pillars remain one of the most iconic astrophotography subjects in the sky.</p><img alt="The Eagle Nebula (Pillars of Creation)" src="images/eagle_nebula_pillars.jpg"/></div><div class="footer">

<div class="card"><h2>Helix Nebula (NGC 7293)</h2><p class="description">A detailed look at the Helix Nebula, a planetary nebula in the constellation Aquarius formed from the expelled outer layers of a dying Sun-like star. Often nicknamed the Eye of God, it lies about 650 light-years away and is one of the closest and most studied examples of how stars like our Sun end their lives. Wiki: The Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) is a large planetary nebula and represents a late evolutionary phase of a low-mass star, whose exposed core will eventually cool into a white dwarf.</p><img alt="Helix Nebula NGC 7293" src="images/helix_nebula.jpg"/></div><div class="card"><h2>Gear &amp; Locations</h2><p>Primary imaging location: Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA (suburban Bortle 6–7 skies).</p><p>Deep-Sky Imaging Rig:</p><ul><li>SVBONY SV503 80ED apochromatic refractor</li><li>0.8× field flattener/reducer</li><li>SVBONY SV705C main imaging camera</li><li>SVBONY SV165 Mini Guide Scope (30mm f/4)</li><li>SVBONY SV305 guide camera</li><li>Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer GTi tracking mount</li></ul><p>Wide-Field Imaging Rig:</p><ul><li>Nikon D3200 DSLR</li><li>Star Adventurer 2i tracking mount</li><li>Assorted Nikon lenses for Milky Way, aurora, and wide-field sky work</li></ul><p>Processing Workflow:</p><ul><li>DeepSkyStacker (DSS) for calibration and stacking</li><li>Siril for gradient removal, color calibration, stretching, and finishing touches</li></ul><p class="small-note">Most images were captured from my backyard or nearby fields, working through light pollution to reveal the hidden structure of the night sky.</p></div>
